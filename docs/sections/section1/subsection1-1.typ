== Registers

=== General Purpose Registers

The general purpose registers are used to store data and perform arithmetic operations. They are named R0-R31 and are 32 bits wide.

=== CMP Register

The CMP register is used to store the result of a comparison operation. It is set by the CMP instruction, which subtracts the second operand from the first operand and sets the CMP register based on the result.
